  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html" target="_blank" title="css"><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</strong></a> is style sheet language that determines how documents written in a markup language such as HTML are actually displayed on a website. C in CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading. This is because inheriting the style properties of a parent element to descendant elements resembles a waterfall descending in a DOM tree structure. However, as an exception, properties related to the box model such as margin, padding, and border are not inherited. Of course, you can force inheritance by giving an inherit value.</p>
  <p>While the beauty of CSS is that it's easy to write, it becomes more difficult to maintain when you have more elements and the code starts to grow accordingly. Especially when the code is over 1000 lines and not commented out, it can be a challenge for team projects. This can be supplemented by using the selector concept of CSS well, and technologies such as less described below are a means to facilitate the composition of CSS by condition, which is not implemented in existing CSS. Technologies created to supplement this include LESS, Sass, and Stylus.</p>
