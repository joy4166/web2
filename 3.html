  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JS">JavaScript</a> is an object-based script programming language. This language is mainly used within the web browser and has the ability to access built-in objects of other applications. It is also used for server programming as well as for runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation, first under the name Mocha and later under the name LiveScript, and eventually became JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Although JavaScript has similar syntax with Sun Microsystems' Java, this is actually because both languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Aside from the name and syntax, it has more similarities to Self and Scheme than to Java. JavaScript is recognized as the language that best implements the standard specifications of ECMAScript, and was basically supported by most browsers up to ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but from ECMAScript 6 onward, it is compiled with a transpiler for browser compatibility.</p>
